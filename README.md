## Object Oriented Programming with Ruby (Workshop)
  
### Objective
1. understanding concept of classes and objects in Ruby
2. learn how to write and use Ruby classes

### Prep Work
For a brief overview on object-oriented programming, visit [this tutorial](https://www.rubyguides.com/ruby-tutorial/object-oriented-programming/) from Ruby Guides.

For this workshop, we will be using a browser-based IDE from [repl.it](https://repl.it/languages/ruby): https://repl.it/languages/ruby

### Class Examples

To get a crash course on Ruby class inheritance, take a look at the examples in `nonsensical.rb`.

### Why Object Oriented Programming?
There is a huge [debate](https://wiki.c2.com/?OopArgumentsDebatesAndDiscussion) surrounding OOP and other programming language paradigms.

In Ruby, everything is an object. Thus, not wanting to embrace OOP when coding in Ruby is self sabotage...

### Exercise

1. Go to https://repl.it/github/nyako/ruby-oo-workshop
2. Open up the file assignment.rb
3. In our assignment, we shall implement a query class that looks up and computes COVID-19 daily statistics in Malaysia
4. You are given a dataset in the form of a CSV file
5. Refer to the instructions given in assignment.rb
